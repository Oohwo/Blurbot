# Blurbot

## Description
"Blurbot" is a Discord bot written in Python to keep track of my rants, blurbs, and timely shenanigans.

I wrote this because I don't want to burden my friends with rambling my mouth off, and it's a cool first Discord bot :)

## Current Commands
`$help` - Shows all commands

`$currently_feeling` - Tell Blur how you're feeling

`$new_quote` - Hear something interesting? Tell it to Blurbot!

## Installation
1) Generate the bot on Discord and grab the token
2) Create a database on Airtable, grab the API token and base ID
3) Code??? Ahh, something with a virtual environment
4) Run
